### xavax


Organizations of any kind gathering data on people, manipulating people with the data they collect & use the data to incriminate people when it's beneficial for themselves; authoritarian countries with centralized leaders feeding their egos while causing needless suffering to certain groups of people, making it harder for anyone to make an actual difference; Let's try to do our best to change all of that. With some powerful cryptographic primitives we can build tools that make it very difficult to censor & connect people together directly, without any middle-man.

[xavax.io](https://xavax.io) web 3.0 projects, tools and stuff for decentralized networks, use the tools to build self custodial shit.


#### xavax-avalanche
The xavax-avalanche SDK is a fully feature complete Rust-based SDK for avalanche, you can select which features to include with the library which allow you to:
* Create any kind of avalanche transaction, on all chains *running on hopefully any subnet*.
* Create, import & derive keychains.
* Sign transactions
* Broadcast them to avalanche nodes
All with one SDK! (very wip).

#### vulture
The multi-chain [vulture](https://vulturewallet.net) wallet is another xavax.io project, non-custodial & fully open-source multi-chain wallet which aims to support all chains that have been proven to be very beneficial in the goal of creating a decentralized future; you know, one without annoying & useless politicians, oh and it has a sleek UI (if I may say so myself), I like building pretty things...
