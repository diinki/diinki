### XAVAX


Monopolies gathering data on people, manipulating people with the data they collect. Authoritarian countries with centralized leaders feeding their egos while causing needless suffering to certain groups of people, making it harder for anyone to make an actual difference. Let's try to do our best to change all of that.

[xavax](https://xavax.io) web 3.0 projects, Tools and stuff for decentralized networks, use the tools to build self custodial shit.


The xavax-avalanche SDK is a fully feature complete SDK for avalanche, if you use the Dev-branch, you can select which features to include which allow you to:
* Create any kind of avalanche transaction, on all chains.
* Create and import keychains.
* Sign transactions
* Broadcast them to avalanche nodes
All with one SDK! (very wip).
