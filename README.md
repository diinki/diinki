### DIINKIROWO theme

The theme-pack I use for VScode can be found by searching *diinkirowo* in the extension marketplace in visual studio code!
I made it myself and it has a bunch of themes with my favorite color combinations! A very dark-mode theme.

Examples of two of the themes that comes with the pack:
