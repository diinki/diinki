I'm diinki (or Ira). An Engineer coder boi that creates things, wanna read my writings, or see what projects I'm involved with?
I've got some things on my personal [imp.works](https://imp.works) website! :D


## xavax.io project

[xavax.io](https://xavax.io) web 3.0 apps & tools n' stuff for decentralized networks, use the tools to build self custodial shit, or use the software by xavax.io to be a self-custodian; become less dependent on centralized organizations & governments that steal & spy on our data, using it to further manipulate us.

<h2 align="center">xavax-avalanche</h2>
The xavax-avalanche SDK is a feature complete Rust-based SDK for avalanche, you can select which features to include with the library which allow you to:
* Create any kind of avalanche transaction, on all chains *on hopefully any subnet*.
* Create, import & derive keychains.
* Sign transactions
* Broadcast them to avalanche nodes
All with one SDK! (very wip).

<h2 align="center">Vulture wallet</h2>
The multi-chain [vulture](https://vulturewallet.net) wallet is a non-custodial & fully open-source multi-chain wallet which aims to support all chains that have been proven to be very beneficial in the goal of creating a decentralized future; you know, one without annoying & useless politicians.

oh and it has a sleek UI (if I may say so myself), I like building pretty things...
