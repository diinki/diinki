### XAVAX


me diinki, I dislike corporations that steal data, authoritarianism and any large centralized power with potential for power abuse! Web3 for me represents decentralization & censorship resistance, freedom...

I try to help with my code, like my with my [xavax](https://xavax.io) web3 project! Tools and stuff for decentralized networks! weally cool


here is one Rust library which implements the Avalanche transaction format for anything such as creating subnets, transactions of any kind, staking n stuff, its used in the Metro wallet ecosystem by xavax! Chek it out :D
